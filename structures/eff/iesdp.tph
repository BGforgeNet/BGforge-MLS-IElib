 * - The `BG1` engine treats probability as a single word, effects are applied in the range `0–probability`.
 * - Other engines treat probability as two values. When an event fires, a random number (let us denote it by `x`) in the `0–99` range is generated. If [`Probability1`](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v1.htm#effv1_Header_0x12), the event fires.

 *     - if you set both [`Probability1`](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v1.htm#effv1_Header_0x12) and [`Probability2`](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v1.htm#effv1_Header_0x13) to `0`, you get an effect with a 1％ chance of firing (it fires whenever the random number generator spits out zero).
 *     - if you set [`Probability1`](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v1.htm#effv1_Header_0x12) to `1` and [`Probability2`](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v1.htm#effv1_Header_0x13) to `0` (as, e.g., happens in BGT/BGEE's implementation of the iron crisis), you don't get an effect with a 1％ chance of firing, but one with a 2％ chance of firing.
 * - An effect's probabilities are rolled on the sprite the effect is applied to. This means that an effect targeting [`Projectile Target`](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v1.htm#effv1_Header_0x2_2) will have the target roll that effect's probabilities, not the attacker or caster. This decouples the split probability roll and allows both to occur at the same time, since each sprite rolls separately. As a consequence it is not directly possible to synchronize effects with partial probabilities that are applied to different targets (e.g. [`Projectile Target`](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v1.htm#effv1_Header_0x2_2) and [`Self`](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v1.htm#effv1_Header_0x2_1)).

 * When this field is used as `Minimum Level`:
 * - A `7 ➔ 1` dual-class character qualifies as HD 7, even though the level 7 class is still inactive.
 * - A `1/7/1` multi-class character qualifies as HD 7, not level 3 (average).
 * - The [2nd](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x235)/[3rd](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x236) class levels are NOT included for single-classes.
 *   - A `1/30/1` single-class qualifies as HD 1.
